Added to that is the inablity to efficient vaxinate the people that need to get vaccinated quickly. Instead, they claim that the vaccine availability is responsible for the delays and still Greece is doing much better that most of its European partners.\n\nSecond is the sense in many people, I am adding myself to them, that they haven't get infected by the virus so far because they have behaved responsibly and not because of the right measures of the government. All these months so far what the government does is to control and fine people who have been layed of their jobs or their job has been put in a halt and get paid a small amount of compensation by the state. If I have escaped infection so far it is because I keep wearing mask for a year now, even when the local virologists were talking against the measure, keep avoiding local transportations and use only my feet or my car, avoid mass gatherings, avoid going to supermarkets and pharmacies on rush hours,  avoid family obligations as nameday celebrations, funerals and memorial services, wear two masks lately and washing my hands thoroughly. All these months I have the feeling that in the battle against the virus I am totally alone.\n\nWhat I see for the future is a very late slowdown of new infections rate since the lockdown has proven ineffective.\n\n* Contrary to those coronavirus-related articles that come with very bad-tasted coronavirus photos ith its red \"spikes\", I prefer to depict my favourite insect, the lady bug, searching for food.",author:a,slug:"coronavirus-anniversary",publishedAt:a,locale:"el",published_at:"2021-03-21T10:39:17.688Z",created_at:"2021-03-21T10:39:12.499Z",updated_at:"2021-03-21T10:54:57.983Z",image:{id:72,name:"IMG_1940.PNG",alternativeText:e,caption:e,width:360,height:640,formats:{thumbnail:{name:"thumbnail_IMG_1940.PNG",hash:f,ext:b,mime:c,width:88,height:156,size:39.11,path:a,url:"https:\u002F\u002Fres.cloudinary.com\u002Fdquiczwzu\u002Fimage\u002Fupload\u002Fv1616323139\u002Fthumbnail_IMG_1940_ff33520537.png",provider_metadata:{public_id:f,resource_type:d}},small:{name:"small_IMG_1940.PNG",hash:g,ext:b,mime:c,width:281,height:500,size:372.99,path:a,url:"https:\u002F\u002Fres.cloudinary.com\u002Fdquiczwzu\u002Fimage\u002Fupload\u002Fv1616323141\u002Fsmall_IMG_1940_ff33520537.png",provider_metadata:{public_id:g,resource_type:d}}},hash:h,ext:b,mime:c,size:391.56,url:"https:\u002F\u002Fres.cloudinary.com\u002Fdquiczwzu\u002Fimage\u002Fupload\u002Fv1616323138\u002FIMG_1940_ff33520537.png",previewUrl:a,provider:"cloudinary",provider_metadata:{public_id:h,resource_type:d},created_at:"2021-03-21T10:39:02.068Z",updated_at:"2021-03-21T10:39:02.154Z"},moreImages:[],localizations:[]}}],fetch:{},mutations:[]}}(null,".PNG","image\u002Fpng","image","","thumbnail_IMG_1940_ff33520537","small_IMG_1940_ff33520537","IMG_1940_ff33520537")));
